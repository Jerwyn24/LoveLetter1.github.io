                                       I love you and my whole world revolves around you now. You are the only true love I've ever known. All my life I prayed for someone like you and am grateful that I finally found you. Promise me that you will always be mine! I know in my heart my love for you will never die, and you will always be a part of me.

                                       Every day I hunger for your gentle touch and warm embrace. I can't really find the right words to describe how I feel about you, but I want to tell you that I love you and I always will.
